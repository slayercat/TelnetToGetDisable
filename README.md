TelnetToGetDisable
==================

telnet to switch and recovery from automatic disable(with STP).

In college we may use stp to protect students from broadcast storm (from ring circuit). this project will telnet to switch every minutes. and will display results in a web page at port 9999.

you may recovery it using command (need set allowance and command to recovery in switch type setting page), and get recovery result in next flushing(automatic or manually).

only having chinese version now, and not propare for i18n. but any imporve (no matter if it's related to internationalizationï¼‰ is welcomed.

i'm now seeking for successor for this project.
